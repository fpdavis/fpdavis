I am an Application Development Manager and Scrum Master with a background in software development, data management, and machine learning in environments including eCommerce, health care, publishing, and entertainment. I have a strong interest in Orbital Mechanics and Human Space Flight. I enjoy putting together and managing small and medium size teams for application development. I enjoy learning and programming in my spare time and am currently learning Unity and doing a deep dive into machine learning.
